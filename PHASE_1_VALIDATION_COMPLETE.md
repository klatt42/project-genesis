   - Production-quality specifications
   - Comprehensive code examples
   - Enterprise-grade planning
   - Think modes used appropriately

2. **Context Efficiency** (10/10)
   - 76% token reduction (exceeds 60% goal by 16%)
   - Clear P0/P1/P2/P3 strategy
   - Claude applies strategy intelligently

3. **Workflow Integration** (9/10)
