**Commit**: feat: Week 5 Task 5 - Integrate with Week 4 Workflow
**Files**: 4 modified files (~70 lines added)
**Location**: `agents/workflow-coordinator/`

### Changes Made:

1. **CLI Integration** (index.ts)
   - **New Flags**:
     * `--parallel-workers <n>`: Enable parallel execution (1-10 workers, default: 3)
     * `--parallel-strategy <s>`: Scheduling strategy (6 options)
     * `--no-autoscale`: Disable auto-scaling
     * `--show-dashboard`: Show real-time TUI dashboard
   - Updated help text with Week 5 examples
   - Argument parsing for all new flags
   - Input validation (worker count 1-10, valid strategies)

2. **Type Definitions** (types.ts)
   - Added `parallelExecution` optional config to `WorkflowConfig`:
     ```typescript
     parallelExecution?: {
       enabled: boolean;
       workerCount?: number;
       autoScaling?: boolean;
       schedulingStrategy?: SchedulingStrategy;
       showDashboard?: boolean;
     }
     ```
   - 100% backward compatible (all fields optional)

3. **Workflow Integration** (workflow.ts)
   - Parallel execution detection in build stage
   - Integration point with detailed TODO
   - Informative console output when parallel mode enabled
   - Graceful fallback to sequential execution (Week 4 compatible)

4. **Build Configuration** (tsconfig.json)
   - Excluded test-saas and test-workflow directories
   - Prevents build errors from test outputs

### Compatibility:
- ✅ Week 4 workflows unchanged (no flags = sequential)
- ✅ Week 5 opt-in with `--parallel-workers` flag
- ✅ All existing CLI flags continue to work
- ✅ No breaking changes

### Example Usage:
```bash
# Sequential execution (Week 4)
node dist/workflow-coordinator/index.js "Build landing page"

# Parallel execution with 5 workers (Week 5)
node dist/workflow-coordinator/index.js "Build SaaS app" \
  --parallel-workers 5 \
  --show-dashboard

# Advanced parallel with custom strategy
node dist/workflow-coordinator/index.js "Complex project" \
  --parallel-workers 8 \
  --parallel-strategy CRITICAL_PATH \
  --no-autoscale
```

### Future Work:
- Implement full ParallelExecutor integration in workflow.ts
- Load execution plan and convert to parallel tasks
- Wire up dashboard display during build
- Add parallel execution metrics to WorkflowResult
- Integration testing with real-world projects
