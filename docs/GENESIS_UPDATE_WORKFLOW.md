# Genesis Update Workflow
## Systematic Process for Contributing Project Learnings to Genesis

**Purpose**: Capture project insights ‚Üí Evaluate ‚Üí Package ‚Üí Contribute ‚Üí Integrate
**Goal**: Make Genesis continuously better through real-world project feedback
**Principle**: Natural capture, systematic contribution

## üéØ Workflow Overview

```
Project Work
     |
     v
Daily Notes (.genesis/)
     |
     v
Pattern Recognition
     |
     v
Evaluation (Should this be in Genesis?)
     |
     v
Packaging (Genesis-ready format)
     |
     v
Contribution (PR or direct update)
     |
     v
Integration into Genesis
     |
     v
All Projects Benefit
```

**Time Investment**:
- During project: 0 extra time (notes already being taken)
- Pattern identification: 5-10 min/day (part of daily compression)
- Packaging: 15-30 min per contribution
- Total overhead: <1% of project time for 100% Genesis improvement

---

## üìù Phase 1: Capture During Projects

### What to Capture

**In .genesis/2_decisions.md**:
- Technical choices that worked particularly well
- Alternatives considered and why rejected
- When Genesis docs helped (and when they didn't)
- Decisions that could become Genesis patterns

**In .genesis/4_commands.md**:
- Command sequences that were used multiple times
- Successful automation scripts
- Time-saving command patterns
- Repeatable deployment/setup workflows

**In .genesis/5_errors.md**:
- Errors not covered in Genesis troubleshooting
- Common pitfalls with integrations
- Solutions that could help others
- Genesis doc clarifications needed

**In .genesis/6_learnings.md**:
- "Genesis Impact" field in every learning entry
- Patterns that could apply to other projects
- Improvements to existing Genesis patterns
- Missing Genesis documentation identified

**Tag Format**:
```markdown
**Genesis Impact**: [None / Minor / Major / Critical]
**Genesis Doc**: [Specific .md file that should be updated]
**Genesis Type**: [Pattern / Command / Integration / Troubleshooting / Clarification]
```

### Capture Examples

**Good - Actionable Genesis Impact**:
```markdown
## OAuth Integration Learning

Successfully integrated Google OAuth using oauth2-server package.
Pattern works for any OAuth provider with minimal changes.

**Genesis Impact**: Major
**Genesis Doc**: STACK_SETUP.md - Authentication Section
**Genesis Type**: Pattern + Commands
**Why**: Repeatable pattern missing from Genesis, would save 2-3 hours per project
```

**Good - Documentation Gap**:
```markdown
## Supabase RLS Policy Error

Documentation says to set up RLS but doesn't mention all 4 CRUD operations.
Only setting SELECT policy is common mistake.

**Genesis Impact**: Minor (but common issue)
**Genesis Doc**: STACK_SETUP.md - Supabase Section
**Genesis Type**: Clarification + Troubleshooting
**Why**: Prevents common 30-minute debugging session
```

**Not Genesis-worthy**:
```markdown
## Project-Specific API Integration

Integrated with client's custom API. Very specific to their system.
Authentication uses their proprietary tokens.

**Genesis Impact**: None
**Genesis Type**: N/A - Project-specific
**Why**: Won't help other projects
```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Phase 2: Evaluate Genesis-Worthiness

### Evaluation Criteria

#### ‚úÖ Definitely Genesis (Contribute These)

**Patterns**:
- Used successfully in 2+ projects
- Solves common problem across project types
- Has clear implementation steps
- Works with Genesis tech stack

**Commands/Scripts**:
- Reusable across projects
- Saves significant time (>30 minutes)
- Tested and reliable
- Clear documentation possible

**Integrations**:
- Common third-party service
- Works with Genesis stack
- Clear setup process
- Adds valuable functionality

**Troubleshooting**:
- Common error/issue
- Clear solution
- Helps others avoid debugging time
- Not already in Genesis docs

**Documentation**:
- Gap in current Genesis docs
- Clarification that prevents confusion
- Better organization/structure
- Missing examples or use cases

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe Genesis (Needs Review)

- Used successfully in 1 project (might become pattern)
- Somewhat common problem
- Requires significant context
- Partially overlaps with existing Genesis content
- Might be project-type specific (Landing Page only, etc.)

#### ‚ùå Not Genesis (Keep in Project)

- Project-specific customization
- Specific to one client/industry
- Requires proprietary tools/services
- One-off solution
- Already well-documented in Genesis

### Evaluation Decision Tree

```

## üì§ Phase 4: Contribution Methods

### Method 1: Direct Update (Fastest)

**When to use**: You maintain Genesis repository
**Process**:

```bash
# 1. Update Genesis locally
cd ~/project-genesis
git checkout -b feature/[pattern-name]

# 2. Add your packaged contribution to appropriate doc
# Example: Adding to STACK_SETUP.md
code docs/STACK_SETUP.md
# [Add your content in appropriate section]

# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md
code docs/CHANGELOG.md
# Add entry:
# ## [Version] - [Date]
# ### Added
# - [Your pattern]: [Brief description]

# 4. Commit with clear message
git add docs/STACK_SETUP.md docs/CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Add [pattern-name] to STACK_SETUP.md

- Solves [problem]
- Adds [functionality]
- Tested on [projects]"

# 5. Merge and tag
git checkout main
git merge feature/[pattern-name]
git tag v[new-version]
git push origin main --tags

# 6. Update Claude Projects with new Genesis docs
# Regenerate any changed .md files to Claude Projects
```

### Method 2: Contribution Document (Collaborative)

**When to use**: Team environment, want review
**Process**:

```bash
# 1. Create contribution document
cd ~/project-genesis
mkdir -p contributions/pending
code contributions/pending/[pattern-name].md
# [Use package template from Phase 3]

# 2. Add to contributions tracking
code contributions/INDEX.md
# Add entry:
# - [Pattern Name] - [Status] - [Contributor] - [Date]
#   - File: contributions/pending/[pattern-name].md
#   - Target: docs/[TARGET-DOC].md
#   - Review by: [Date]

# 3. Commit contribution
git add contributions/
git commit -m "Contribution: [pattern-name]"
git push

# 4. Request review (however your team handles this)
# Could be: PR, Slack message, email, etc.

# 5. After approval, integrator adds to Genesis docs
# Moves from pending/ to integrated/
# Updates CHANGELOG.md
# Notifies contributor
```

### Method 3: Genesis Update File (Asynchronous)

**When to use**: Working on projects, batch contributions
**Process**:

**During Projects**:
```bash
# In each project with Genesis insights:
# Create genesis_updates_[project-name].md

# Use template:
```

```markdown
# Genesis Updates from [Project Name]

**Project**: [Name]
**Date Range**: [Start] - [End]
**Contributor**: [Your name]

## üí° Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

**During Projects**:
- Tag insights with "Genesis Impact" immediately
- Use standard Genesis terminology
- Think "Will this help others?" when solving problems
- Document why, not just what
- Keep Genesis examples simple and clear

**When Packaging**:
- Use Genesis package templates
- Include real examples from your project
- Add troubleshooting for issues you encountered
- Reference related Genesis patterns
- Make it drop-in ready

**When Contributing**:
- One contribution = one clear improvement
- Don't bundle unrelated changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Test documentation is clear
- Provide context for reviewers

### Don'ts ‚ùå

**Avoid**:
- Project-specific details in Genesis patterns
- Overly complex examples
- Assumptions about reader knowledge
- Contributing untested patterns
- Bundling multiple unrelated improvements
- Forgetting to update related docs
- Breaking existing Genesis workflows

**Never**:
- Add dependencies without discussion
- Change core Genesis structure without team input
- Submit without testing
- Override existing patterns without justification
- Forget CHANGELOG entries

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Week 1: Start Tagging
1. Add "Genesis Impact" to your .genesis/6_learnings.md entries
2. Tag 2-3 insights per project as potential Genesis contributions
3. Don't worry about packaging yet, just identify

### Week 2: Practice Evaluation
1. Review your tagged insights
2. Apply evaluation criteria (Phase 2)
3. Identify 1-2 clear Genesis contributions
4. Discuss with team if collaborative

### Week 3: Package First Contribution
1. Choose your clearest Genesis improvement
2. Use package template (Phase 3)
3. Make it Genesis-ready
4. Don't submit yet, just practice packaging

### Week 4: Make First Contribution
1. Pick packaging from Week 3
2. Choose contribution method (Phase 4)
3. Submit to Genesis
4. Track through integration (Phase 5)

**Goal**: Natural part of project workflow, not extra burden
