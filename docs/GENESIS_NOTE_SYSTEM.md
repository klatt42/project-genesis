# Genesis Note-Taking System Documentation

**Version**: 1.0  
**Pattern Reference**: Pattern 3 (Structured Note-Taking System)  
**Created**: [Date]  
**For**: Project Genesis Phase 1A

---

## Overview

The `.genesis/` directory implements **Pattern 3: Structured Note-Taking System** from the PastorAid project learnings. This system ensures **zero context loss** between Claude conversations and creates a **searchable knowledge base** for every Genesis project.

### Why This System Exists

**The Problem**:
- Context is lost when switching between Claude threads
- Valuable insights discovered during development are forgotten
- Errors recur because solutions weren't documented
- Effective prompts aren't saved for reuse
- Project handoffs are painful and time-consuming

**The Solution**:
Seven specialized note files that capture everything needed to maintain full project context indefinitely.

---

## The Seven Note Files

### Quick Reference Table

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency | Priority |
|------|---------|------------------|----------|
| `1_discovery.md` | Project requirements & research | Setup phase, as needed | High |
| `2_decisions.md` | Technical choices with rationale | After each major decision | Critical |
| `3_prompts.md` | Effective prompt library | When prompt works well | Medium |
| `4_commands.md` | Sequential command history | Real-time during development | Critical |
| `5_errors.md` | Error log with solutions | Immediately when error occurs | High |
| `6_learnings.md` | Insights and patterns | End of session or milestone | Medium |
| `7_handoff.md` | Thread transition summary | Before closing each thread | Critical |

- Create all 7 files from templates
- Complete `1_discovery.md`
- Begin `2_decisions.md` with architecture choices
- Set up `4_commands.md` with initial commands
- Initialize other files

**Active Development**:
- `4_commands.md`: Updated constantly
- `5_errors.md`: Updated as errors occur
- `3_prompts.md`: Updated when prompts work

## Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

1. **Update in Real-Time**
   - Don't wait to document
   - Fresh context is accurate context
   - 2 minutes now saves 20 minutes later

2. **Be Specific**
   - Exact error messages, not summaries
   - Precise file paths and line numbers
   - Clear rationale for decisions

3. **Cross-Reference**
   - Link between .genesis/ files
   - Reference Genesis docs
   - Connect related items

4. **Use Search-Friendly Titles**
   - Clear, descriptive titles
   - Keywords for easy finding
   - Consistent naming patterns

5. **Maintain Handoff Quality**
   - Test readability (read it cold)
   - Include ALL critical context
   - Verify checklist before closing thread

6. **Document Genesis Impact**
   - Note patterns for Genesis updates
   - Track deviations from Genesis
   - Suggest improvements to Genesis

### Don'ts ‚ùå

1. **Don't Postpone Documentation**
   - "I'll document this later" = never documented
   - Context fades quickly
   - Errors recur without documentation

2. **Don't Be Vague**
   - "Fixed some stuff" = useless
   - "Check file" without path = frustrating
   - "Error occurred" without message = can't reproduce

3. **Don't Over-Organize Early**
   - Capture first, organize later
   - Perfect formatting can wait
   - Content > Structure initially

4. **Don't Forget Handoff**
   - Closing thread without handoff = context loss
   - Incomplete handoff = wasted time
   - No handoff checklist = missing items

5. **Don't Ignore Genesis Integration**
   - Not referencing Genesis = missed patterns
   - Not documenting deviations = can't improve Genesis
   - Not noting learnings = Genesis doesn't evolve

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Too much overhead to maintain"
**Solution**: 
- Update files in small increments throughout day
- Use templates (don't start from scratch)
- Focus on critical files (4, 5, 7) first
- Time saved in continuity far exceeds documentation time

**Issue**: "Files are getting too long"
**Solution**:
- That's okay! Better too much than too little
- Use search (Ctrl+F) to find content
- Consider archiving completed phases
- Quick reference sections at top of each file

**Issue**: "Forgetting to update files"
**Solution**:
- Make it part of workflow (end-of-session ritual)
- Use handoff checklist
- Start small (just log commands and errors)
- Build habit over first week

**Issue**: "Don't know what to write"
**Solution**:
- Use provided templates and formats
- Ask yourself: "What would I want to know if starting fresh?"
- Write for future you (6 months from now)
- Err on side of too much detail

**Issue**: "Context still lost between threads"
**Solution**:
- Check handoff completeness (use checklist)
- Verify `7_handoff.md` has exact position
- Ensure Genesis context is documented
- Test handoff by reading it without prior knowledge

**Multiple Concurrent Features**:
- Create feature branches in git
- Note in `4_commands.md` which branch
- Track per-feature progress in `7_handoff.md`
- Separate decision logs per major feature

**Long-Running Projects** (months):
- Archive completed phases in `4_commands.md`
- Consolidate learnings periodically in `6_learnings.md`
- Review and update `1_discovery.md` as scope evolves
- Maintain comprehensive `2_decisions.md` for reference

**Team Collaboration**:
- Add "Team Notes" section to relevant files
- Document who made decisions in `2_decisions.md`
- Track parallel work streams in `7_handoff.md`
- Share effective prompts in `3_prompts.md`

### Integration with Other Tools

**GitHub Issues/Projects**:
- Reference issue numbers in .genesis/ files

**Customization Guidelines**:
1. Start with provided templates
2. Add project-specific sections (don't remove standard ones)
3. Maintain consistent formatting
4. Document customizations in template
5. Consider if customization should be in Genesis

**Common Customizations**:
- Additional error categories for domain
