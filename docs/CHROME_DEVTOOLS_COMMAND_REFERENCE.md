## üìù Notes & Best Practices

### Command Formatting

- **Be specific**: Always include URL (e.g., localhost:3000)
- **Set context**: Specify which section if validating components
- **Request format**: Ask for structured reports when needed
- **Save reports**: Always save reports to docs/quality-reports/

### Interpreting Results

**Quality Scores:**
- **9.0-10.0**: Excellent - deploy with confidence
- **8.0-8.9**: Good - deploy with minor notes
- **7.0-7.9**: Acceptable - fix before deployment
- **< 7.0**: Not ready - significant issues

**Performance Metrics:**
- **LCP < 2.5s**: Good
- **CLS < 0.1**: Good
- **FID < 100ms**: Good

**Priority Levels:**
- **High**: Must fix before deployment
- **Medium**: Fix in next sprint
- **Low**: Enhancement for future

### Common Pitfalls

‚ùå **Don't**: Run scans on external URLs without permission
‚ùå **Don't**: Skip baseline scans before making changes
‚ùå **Don't**: Ignore accessibility issues
‚ùå **Don't**: Deploy with score < 8.0

‚úÖ **Do**: Clear cache between performance tests
‚úÖ **Do**: Test on localhost first
‚úÖ **Do**: Save all quality reports
‚úÖ **Do**: Track scores over time

## üéì Learning Resources

### Understanding Metrics

**LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**:
- Measures: Time for largest visible element to render
- Target: < 2.5s
- Common causes: Large images, slow server response

**CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**:
- Measures: Visual stability during load
- Target: < 0.1
- Common causes: Images without dimensions, web fonts

**FID/INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**:
- Measures: Responsiveness to user interactions
- Target: < 100ms
- Common causes: Long JavaScript tasks, blocking main thread

### WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference

**Level AA Requirements:**
- Color contrast: ‚â• 4.5:1 (normal text)
- All images have alt text
- All forms have labels
- Keyboard navigation works
- Focus indicators visible
