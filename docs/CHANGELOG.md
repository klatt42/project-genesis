  - No restart required after fix - changes take effect immediately

### Added
- **Troubleshooting Documentation**: Created `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - Skills invocation debugging guide
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Links to relevant Genesis skills for detailed troubleshooting

### Verified
- ✅ All 16 Genesis skills visible to Claude Code
- ✅ Single-skill prompts working
- ✅ Multi-skill complex prompts working
- ✅ Skills auto-invoke without blocking
- ✅ Genesis patterns applied automatically

### Testing
- Completed multi-skill test suite
- Verified complex project setup prompts:
  - "Start a new landing page project with Supabase and deploy to Netlify"
  - "Build a SaaS app with authentication, analytics, and AI features"
  - "Create a multi-step form that captures leads to GoHighLevel with analytics"
- Confirmed skills orchestration working
- Tested on restaurant landing page scenario

### Technical Details
- **Discovery Date**: October 23, 2025
- **Discovered During**: Multi-skill complex prompt testing

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added - Phase 1A: Pattern 4 Implementation & Template System

**Pattern 4: Smart Context Compaction** (Complete meta-pattern system):
- 5 compression techniques with detailed explanations
- 3 workflow levels (daily 5-10 min / milestone 15-20 min / project completion 30-45 min)
- Genesis contribution process (5-phase systematic workflow)
- Measurement & validation framework (4 core metrics)
- Complete integration across all templates

**Template System** (Structured note-taking for all projects):
- `templates/claude.md`: Master project instruction file template
- `templates/.genesis/` directory: 7 specialized note files
  - `1_discovery.md`: Requirements & research tracking
  - `2_decisions.md`: Technical decisions log with rationale
  - `3_prompts.md`: Reusable prompt library
  - `4_commands.md`: Command history with progress indicators
  - `5_errors.md`: Error solutions log
  - `6_learnings.md`: Insights & patterns journal
  - `7_handoff.md`: Thread transition template
- `docs/GENESIS_NOTE_SYSTEM.md`: Complete system documentation

**Pattern 4 Documentation** (4 comprehensive guides):
- `docs/PATTERN_4_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`: Single-page quick reference
- `docs/GENESIS_UPDATE_WORKFLOW.md`: Systematic contribution process
- `docs/PATTERN_4_VALIDATION.md`: Measurement framework with 4 core metrics
- `docs/patterns/STACK_SETUP.md`: Enhanced with compression techniques

**Milestone Compression Checklist** (Day 5 addition):
- Systematic 20-step checklist for milestone compression
- Validated during Phase 1A Day 4 testing (40% compression achieved)
- Integrated into PATTERN_4_VALIDATION.md
- Cross-referenced in PATTERN_4_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

**Documentation Enhancements**:
- `STACK_SETUP.md`: Enhanced with Pattern 4 compression techniques
- `PROJECT_KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md`: Updated with .genesis/ setup steps
- `CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Added Pattern 4 workflow commands
- All templates enhanced with Pattern 4 integration sections

**New Directories**:
- `docs/patterns/`: Pattern documentation
- `templates/`: Project templates (claude.md + .genesis/ structure)
- `contributions/`: Genesis improvement tracking system

### Changed
- All `.genesis/` templates: Added compression tracking sections
- `templates/claude.md`: Enhanced with Pattern 4 implementation guide
- `templates/.genesis/6_learnings.md`: Added Pattern 4 Effectiveness Dashboard
- `templates/.genesis/7_handoff.md`: Added Compression Status section

### Validated
- **Day 4 Testing** (October 19, 2025): Complete Pattern 4 system validation
  - All 5 compression techniques tested (40% reduction achieved)
  - Daily workflow validated (7 min, target 5-10 min)
  - Milestone workflow validated (20 min, target 15-20 min)
  - Genesis contribution process validated (27 min per contribution)
  - All 4 core metrics measured and met
  - Overall Grade: A (92/100) - Production Ready

### Benefits
- **Thread transitions**: <13 minutes (vs 30+ minutes previously)
- **Knowledge retention**: 40% compression with zero critical info loss
- **Genesis improvements**: 7 contributions identified per project (target: 5+)
- **Information retrieval**: <30 seconds average (target: <30 sec)
- **Systematic capture**: All project insights systematically improve Genesis

### Migration Path
- **Existing projects**: Optional adoption of .genesis/ system
- **New projects**: Copy templates from `templates/` directory
- **Pattern 4**: Start with daily compression (5-10 min), expand naturally
- **No breaking changes**: All existing Genesis functionality preserved
