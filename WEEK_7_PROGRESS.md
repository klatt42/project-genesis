## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### For Pattern Extraction
- Consider using TypeScript Compiler API for parsing
- Extract patterns at multiple levels:
  - Component level (React components, hooks)
  - File level (layouts, pages, utilities)
  - Architecture level (folder structure, routing patterns)
- Use embeddings (e.g., OpenAI embeddings) for semantic similarity

### For Component Library
- Follow NPM package structure
- Support TypeScript definitions
- Include tests with components
- Generate documentation automatically
- Handle peer dependencies properly

### For Unified Monitoring
- Reuse existing monitoring agent connections
- Implement efficient metric caching
- Real-time updates with polling or webhooks
- Portfolio-level alerting with smart routing

### For Knowledge Graph
- Simple graph structure in JSON
- Could upgrade to graph database (e.g., Neo4j) later
- AI-powered insights using LLM
- Track graph evolution over time
