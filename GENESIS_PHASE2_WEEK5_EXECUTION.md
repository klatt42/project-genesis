# Genesis Agent SDK - Phase 2 Week 5 Execution
## Multi-Agent Parallelization

**WSL Directory**: `~/Developer/projects/project-genesis`  
**Claude Code Project**: `~/Developer/projects/project-genesis`  
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4) complete âœ…

---

## WEEK 5 GOAL

Enable **parallel agent execution** for 2-3x speed improvement:
- Multiple Build agents work simultaneously on independent tasks
- Task queue manager distributes work optimally
- Shared state coordination prevents conflicts
- Real-time progress dashboard

---

## TASK 1: PARALLEL TASK EXECUTOR

### Claude Code Directive

```
Create parallel task execution system for Genesis agents.

Location: agents/parallel-executor/

Requirements:
1. Task queue manager with priority scheduling
2. Worker pool (configurable agent count, default: 3)
3. Dependency resolver (only run tasks when dependencies complete)
4. State synchronization (prevent file conflicts)
5. Progress aggregation (real-time status for all agents)
6. Error isolation (one agent failure doesn't stop others)

Files to create:
- agents/parallel-executor/task-queue.ts (~300 lines)
- agents/parallel-executor/worker-pool.ts (~400 lines)
- agents/parallel-executor/dependency-resolver.ts (~250 lines)
- agents/parallel-executor/state-coordinator.ts (~350 lines)
- agents/parallel-executor/progress-aggregator.ts (~200 lines)
- agents/parallel-executor/types.ts (~150 lines)
- agents/parallel-executor/index.ts

TypeScript, full types, handle edge cases.
```

**Verify**: `npm test agents/parallel-executor`

## TASK 2: AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### Claude Code Directive

```
Create coordination protocol for parallel Genesis agents.

Location: agents/coordination/

Requirements:
1. Lock manager for file system resources
2. Message bus for inter-agent communication
3. Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
4. State snapshots for rollback capability
5. Health monitoring for all agents
6. Automatic recovery from agent crashes

Files to create:
- agents/coordination/lock-manager.ts (~300 lines)
- agents/coordination/message-bus.ts (~350 lines)
- agents/coordination/conflict-resolver.ts (~400 lines)
- agents/coordination/snapshot-manager.ts (~250 lines)
- agents/coordination/health-monitor.ts (~200 lines)
- agents/coordination/types.ts (~150 lines)
- agents/coordination/index.ts

TypeScript, full types, production-ready.
```

**Verify**: `npm test agents/coordination`
