## 🆘 If Things Break

### Emergency Troubleshooting

**If context seems lost**:
1. Read this entire file
2. Check `claude.md`
3. Review `.genesis/` directory
4. Look at git log: `git log --oneline -10`
5. Check what changed: `git diff`

**If environment broken**:
1. Check `.env.local` exists and has values
2. Verify Supabase project is accessible
3. Test external service connections
4. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

**If build broken**:
1. Check `.genesis/5_errors.md` for similar issues
2. Verify all imports are case-correct
3. Check environment variables in Netlify
4. Try clean install: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**If completely stuck**:
1. Revert to last working commit
2. Review decisions in `.genesis/2_decisions.md`
3. Check Genesis docs for guidance
4. Document the issue in `.genesis/5_errors.md`
