## Technical Learnings

### Learning: Supabase RLS Policy Patterns
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Technical - Database  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Implementing user-scoped data access for [feature]

**What I Learned**:
The most common RLS policy patterns:

```sql
-- Pattern 1: User owns their records
CREATE POLICY "Users see own records"
  ON table_name FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Pattern 2: Public read, authenticated write
CREATE POLICY "Public read" ON table_name
  FOR SELECT TO anon USING (true);
  
CREATE POLICY "Auth write" ON table_name
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Pattern 3: Organization-scoped (SaaS)
CREATE POLICY "Team members see org data"
  ON table_name FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    org_id IN (
      SELECT org_id FROM memberships
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Security is handled at database level
- Can't be bypassed by client-side code
- Policies are reusable patterns

**How to Apply**:
- Start with Genesis RLS templates
- Test policies with different user types
- Document custom policies in project

**Genesis Impact**:
Genesis STACK_SETUP.md already has good RLS section - these examples reinforce it.

### Learning: TypeScript Interface Organization
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Technical - TypeScript  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Managing types across multiple components and services

**What I Learned**:
Best structure for TypeScript types in this project:

```
src/types/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.ts      # Supabase table types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.ts           # External API response types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components.ts    # Component prop types
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts         # Re-export all types
```

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for types
- Easy to find and update
- Prevents duplicate type definitions
- Imports are clean: `import { User } from '@/types'`

**Why It Matters**:
- Reduced type errors by 80%
- Faster development (autocomplete works)
- Easier refactoring

**How to Apply**:
1. Create `types/` directory at project start
2. Define types before building components
3. Export from `index.ts` for clean imports
4. Update types immediately when schema changes

**Genesis Impact**:
üìù COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md could include TypeScript organization pattern

---

### Learning: Error Handling Pattern That Works
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Technical - Error Handling  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Implementing form submissions and API calls

**What I Learned**:
Consistent error handling pattern:

```typescript
// Custom hook for error handling
const useApiCall = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const execute = async (apiCall: () => Promise<any>) => {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    
    try {
      const result = await apiCall();
      return { success: true, data: result };
    } catch (err) {
      const message = err instanceof Error 
        ? err.message 
        : 'An unexpected error occurred';
      setError(message);
      return { success: false, error: message };
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return { execute, loading, error };
};

// Usage in components
const { execute, loading, error } = useApiCall();

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  const result = await execute(() => 
    supabase.from('table').insert(data)
  );
  
  if (result.success) {
    // Handle success
  }
};
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Consistent error UX across app
- Loading states automatically managed
- Easy to add error logging
- Reduces boilerplate in components

**How to Apply**:
- Create this hook at project start
- Use for all async operations
- Extend with success notifications
- Add error logging service integration

**Genesis Impact**:
‚úÖ Strong pattern for COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md

### Learning: Netlify Function Best Practices
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Technical - Serverless  
**Confidence**: Medium

**Context**:
Creating webhook handlers and API proxies

**What I Learned**:
Key patterns for Netlify functions:

1. **Always validate input**
```typescript
export const handler: Handler = async (event) => {
  // Validate HTTP method
  if (event.httpMethod !== 'POST') {
    return { statusCode: 405, body: 'Method Not Allowed' };
  }
  
  // Validate body exists
  if (!event.body) {
    return { statusCode: 400, body: 'Missing body' };
  }
  
  // Parse and validate data
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.body);
    // Validate required fields
  } catch {
    return { statusCode: 400, body: 'Invalid JSON' };
  }
};
```

2. **Use environment variables**
```typescript
const apiKey = process.env.SERVICE_API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) {
  console.error('Missing API key');
  return { statusCode: 500, body: 'Configuration error' };
}
```

3. **Return proper status codes**
- 200: Success
- 400: Bad request (client error)
- 401: Unauthorized
- 500: Server error

**Why It Matters**:
- Security (validation prevents attacks)
- Debugging (proper errors help find issues)
- Reliability (handles edge cases)

**How to Apply**:
- Create function template with validation
- Test error cases, not just happy path
- Add logging for debugging
- Monitor function logs in Netlify

**Genesis Impact**:
STACK_SETUP.md Netlify functions section could expand on these patterns

## Process Learnings

### Learning: Genesis Pattern Application Flow
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Process - Workflow  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Using Genesis throughout this project

**What I Learned**:
Most effective Genesis workflow:

1. **Start with project type identification**
   - Spend 10 minutes clearly defining: Landing Page vs SaaS
   - This determines EVERYTHING else

2. **Load Genesis docs progressively** (Pattern 2)
   - Phase 1: PROJECT_KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md + [project type].md
   - Phase 2: STACK_SETUP.md (as needed per integration)
   - Phase 3: COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md + COPILOTKIT_PATTERNS.md
   - Phase 4: DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

3. **Create .genesis/ notes from day 1**
   - Don't wait - start documenting immediately
   - 5 minutes per file setup saves hours later

4. **Check Genesis before building custom**
   - Always ask: "Does Genesis have this pattern?"
   - Saves 30-60 minutes per feature

**Why It Matters**:
- 3-4x faster development than without Genesis
- Consistent quality across features
- Knowledge captured for future

**How to Apply**:
Every new Genesis project:
1. Create claude.md from template
2. Set up .genesis/ directory
3. Follow progressive doc loading
4. Document deviations immediately

**Genesis Impact**:
This learning validates Genesis workflow - maybe add to CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md

### Learning: Claude Code Prompt Patterns
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Process - AI Collaboration  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Finding what prompts work best with Claude Code

**What I Learned**:
Most effective prompt structure:

```
claude-code "Create [specific component/feature] following [GENESIS_DOC.md - Section] with:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Please include [error handling/types/tests/etc]"
```

**Why specific structure works**:
- "Create" is action-oriented
- Genesis doc reference provides context
- Bullet points are clear requirements
- Explicit asks prevent omissions

**Less effective patterns**:
- ‚ùå "Build auth" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "How do I..." (asking vs directing)
- ‚ùå No Genesis reference (misses patterns)

**Why It Matters**:
- First attempt quality much higher
- Less back-and-forth
- Genesis patterns applied correctly

**How to Apply**:
- Document effective prompts in .genesis/3_prompts.md
- Reference Genesis docs in every prompt
- Be specific about requirements
- State success criteria

**Genesis Impact**:
Add to CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md - "Effective Prompt Patterns" section

---

### Learning: Thread Transition Best Practices
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Process - Context Management  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Needing to close thread but continue later

**What I Learned**:
Perfect thread transition process:

1. **Before closing thread**:
   - Update .genesis/7_handoff.md completely
   - Note EXACT file and line of current work
   - List next 3 specific actions
   - Commit and push all code

2. **Handoff summary must include**:
   - Genesis docs currently loaded
   - Current phase in PROJECT_KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md
   - Environment status (what's configured)
   - Known issues or blockers
   - WSL and Claude Code paths

3. **Starting new thread**:
   - Load claude.md first
   - Read .genesis/7_handoff.md
   - Verify environment still configured
   - Continue from documented position

**Why It Matters**:
- Zero context loss between sessions
- Can pick up in 2 minutes vs 20
- No repeated work

**How to Apply**:
- Create handoff before closing ANY thread
- Over-document rather than under
- Test by reading handoff without prior context
- Update as last action before closing

**Genesis Impact**:
‚úÖ This validates Pattern 3 (Structured Notes) - working as designed

## Design & UX Learnings

### Learning: Mobile-First Component Design
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Design - Responsive  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Building responsive components

**What I Learned**:
Mobile-first approach saves time:

```tsx
// Start with mobile styles (default)
<div className="p-4 flex flex-col gap-4">
  
  {/* Then add larger breakpoints */}
  <div className="md:flex-row md:gap-6">
    
    {/* Then desktop */}
    <div className="lg:gap-8 lg:max-w-6xl">
      {/* Content */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Benefits:
- Mobile is constraint-based (forces simplicity)
- Progressive enhancement feels better
- Easier to test (start small)

**Why It Matters**:
- 60%+ traffic is mobile
- Simpler components are better components
- Faster development

**How to Apply**:
1. Design mobile layout first
2. Test on mobile before desktop
3. Add complexity at larger breakpoints
4. Use Tailwind breakpoints: sm: md: lg: xl:

**Genesis Impact**:
COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md could emphasize mobile-first approach

---

### Learning: Form UX Patterns
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Design - Forms  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Creating user-friendly forms

**What I Learned**:
Critical form UX elements:

1. **Loading states** - Button disabled with spinner
2. **Inline validation** - Show errors on blur
3. **Success feedback** - Clear confirmation
4. **Error recovery** - Keep form data on error
5. **Accessibility** - Labels, aria-labels, focus management

Example:
```tsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input
    aria-label="Email address"
    onBlur={validateEmail}
    className={error ? 'border-red-500' : ''}
  />
  {error && (
    <p className="text-red-500 text-sm mt-1">{error}</p>
  )}
  
  <button 
    disabled={loading}
    className="relative"
  >
    {loading ? (
      <Spinner className="absolute" />
    ) : (
      'Submit'
    )}
  </button>
  
  {success && (
    <p className="text-green-600">Success!</p>
  )}
</form>
```

**Why It Matters**:
- User confidence and trust
- Reduced form abandonment
- Better conversion rates

**How to Apply**:
- Use form template with all states
- Test error scenarios
- Add loading indicators to all async actions
- Accessibility from start, not retrofit

**Genesis Impact**:
LANDING_PAGE_TEMPLATE.md form pattern should include these UX elements

## Genesis Pattern Learnings

### Learning: When to Deviate from Genesis
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Genesis Pattern  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Encountering situation not covered by Genesis

**What I Learned**:
Valid reasons to deviate:
1. Project has unique constraint Genesis doesn't address
2. New technology/service not in Genesis yet
3. Performance optimization needed
4. User requirement conflicts with Genesis pattern

**Process for deviations**:
1. Check Genesis thoroughly first
2. Document WHY deviating (in code comments)
3. Note in .genesis/6_learnings.md
4. Evaluate if deviation should become Genesis pattern

**Why It Matters**:
- Genesis is guide, not prison
- Deviations often become Genesis improvements
- Documentation prevents confusion

**How to Apply**:
- Comment code: `// Deviation from Genesis [DOC]: [reason]`
- Track in learning journal
- Share with Genesis maintainer
- Update Genesis if pattern is valuable

**Genesis Impact**:
This meta-pattern should be in Genesis workflow docs

---

### Learning: Genesis Documentation Prioritization
**Date**: [Date]  
**Category**: Genesis Pattern  
**Confidence**: High

**Context**:
Loading too many Genesis docs at once

**What I Learned**:
**Pattern 2: Progressive Context Loading** works best when:

**Phase 1 (Load immediately)**:
- PROJECT_KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md
- [Project type].md (LANDING_PAGE_TEMPLATE or SAAS_ARCHITECTURE)
- STACK_SETUP.md (overview only)

**Phase 2 (Load as needed)**:
- STACK_SETUP.md specific sections (when integrating that service)
- COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md (when building that component type)
- COPILOTKIT_PATTERNS.md (when adding AI features)

**Phase 3 (Load at deployment)**:
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

**Phase 4 (Reference as needed)**:
- CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md (for command syntax)
- ARCHON_PATTERNS.md (for advanced deployment)

**Why It Matters**:
- Prevents context overload
- Relevant info when needed
- Faster task completion

**How to Apply**:
- Track loaded docs in claude.md
- Note "Next to load" in current position
- Unload completed phase docs

**Genesis Impact**:
This IS Pattern 2 working correctly - validates the approach
